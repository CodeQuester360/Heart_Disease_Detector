**Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning**
**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not a person has heart disease based on their medical attributes. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention of heart disease.

**Data** 
Source: The dataset used is the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Features**: The dataset contains 13 attributes related to a patient's medical history, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and thallium stress result. Â  

**Target**: The target variable is binary, indicating whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

**Methodology**

**Data Exploration:**
Analyze data distribution, statistics, and correlations between features.
Visualize data to identify patterns and trends.

**Feature Engineering**
Explore potential feature transformations or creations to improve model performance.
Handle missing values and outliers as needed.

**Model Selection and Training:**
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

**Model Evaluation:**

Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC) to assess model performance.
Employ cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Visualize evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).

**Feature Importance:**
Determine the most influential features in predicting heart disease.

**Libraries and Tools**
